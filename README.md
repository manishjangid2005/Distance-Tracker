# 📏 Distance Tracker Web App

A minimal and efficient distance tracker built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This web-based app allows users to mark two locations (A and B) using their device's GPS and calculates the real-world distance between them.

## 📌 About

This Distance Tracker app uses the Geolocation API to access real-time GPS data, allowing users to set two points—A and B—and instantly measure the distance between them. The calculation is done using 3D spherical geometry (based on Earth’s radius) for higher accuracy.

**Key Features:**
- 📍 Live location display with latitude and longitude
- 🧭 Mark two custom points and measure real-time distance
- ⚡ Works on modern mobile and desktop browsers
- 📐 Spherical geometry used for accurate earth-distance calculation
